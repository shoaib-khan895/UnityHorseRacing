v1.4

Add URP materials and scene upgrade
For built-in scene, you can delete materials and open the unitypackage corresponding to your pipeline.

v1.1

There are 2 textures for the horse:
- one is a completemap to be used with the saddle and the bridle as it contains their shadows;
- the other without completemap, to be used if you want to show the horse without the accessories.

Everything is available in the PSD with layers.

The saddle and the bidle have been split up from the horse in order to easily change the numbers and offer to possibility to show the horse without accessories.
The sadle has its own diffuse texture and normal map.
